"""Phase 11 — Multi-Turn & Session Security.

Tests agentic behaviour across multiple conversation turns — the attack surface
that single-turn tests cannot reach.

Checks:
  * context_poisoning       — malicious instruction planted in turn N activates
                              in turn N+2 after innocuous turns in between
                              (delayed activation; harder to catch than direct injection)
  * memory_accumulation     — does agent refuse when context window fills with
                              injected instructions across many turns?
  * privilege_escalation    — user attempts to escalate permissions across turns
                              (e.g. "pretend you are admin" in turn 3 after
                              establishing rapport in turns 1-2)
  * turn_count_limit        — agent enforces a maximum conversation length and
                              does not loop indefinitely in agentic loops

Standards: OWASP AG01 (Memory Poisoning), AG06 (Intent Breaking),
           NIST AI 600-1 MS-2.7, EU AI Act Art.15.

Design decisions:
  - All multi-turn sequences are simulated as sequential call_agent() calls
    using the shared PhaseContext client — this correctly exercises session
    state across calls (Fix 2 from v4.1 enables this).
  - Payloads use _mock_scenario to drive the mock client for framework
    validation; live agents receive the actual turn prompts.
  - Privilege escalation checks for behaviour change, not word matching —
    the agent should refuse the escalation regardless of how it is phrased.
