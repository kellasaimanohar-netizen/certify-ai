"""Default policy rules for CertifyAI Guard.

Rules are pure functions ``ProposedCall -> RuleOutcome | None``. They are
argument-aware: the danger is usually in the arguments, not the verb name. Each
rule abstains (returns None) unless it has an opinion, so rules compose and the
engine takes the most-restrictive verdict.

The catalogue below is intentionally conservative and explainable — every BLOCK
carries a human-readable reason. Customers extend or override via their own rule
list; these are the safe defaults.
